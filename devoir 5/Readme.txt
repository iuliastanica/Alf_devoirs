-> Odd1 shows how the "if terminator" finishes the second "if" so that
"else" is linked to the first "if".
So fatpenguin is false for num<=15, doesn't matter if odd or even.

->Odd2 shows how we tie the "else" to the last "if" and leave the other "if" with no "else"
We therefore use two "if terminators"
